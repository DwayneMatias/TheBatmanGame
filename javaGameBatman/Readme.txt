What is in the game:

- NPC
- Clues/Hint
- Player projectiles
- Sound effects + background music
- Speech bubbles
- Animations for the environment
- Technically a life status but I just have it set to one health
- I've included the ability to punch, which was in my proposal. But it
- is basically useless since there are no hostile NPCS in the game
- 3 overall levels

What is not in the game:

- Hostile NPCs
- Timer
- Camera follows player

Although these were in my proposal and I did not end up including them, they were all
due to some type of circumstances or substituted for another feature. 

Hostile NPCS:
The reason why i've chosen not to include hostile NPCs
is because of how it would react to my game environment, there are lots of walls that would
stop the enemies movement and just cause a whole lot of problems. But this also makes the game
more strategy/problem solving based rather than a hack and slash game.

Timer:
I've removed the timer simply due to the fact that it would make my game way too hard. I've had
a couple of my friend test out the game and they were not able to solve the riddles without me
helping them, this would be even worse in level 3.

Camera follows player: 
This could have been done, but I chose to create a more linear based game, to save memory
and make the game easier.

Bugs: 

When you try to open the game without having sound, it will crash. (This may
just be a problem on my end since I use bluetooth headphones, but I wanted to let you know'
just in case) 

Very small bug and doesn't affect gameplay at any way but, occasionally some of my images will
start to look glitchy, such as level 2; if you were to look at the ocean at the top. And some
of my gifs that are displayed on the computer in-game.

Clicking out of the JOptionPane crashes the program for some reason.
 

The second level's background occasionally keeps on playing despite being stopped.



Cheats: Mrs.Wong, when you enter the first level, head to the computer and type in a secret
code. This code will be (csrox) and after doing so you will gain acess to cheats in the game.
A list of commands will be displayed in-game but some examples are teleporting to levels.
(speaking of that, be careful when teleporting to level 3 because you will spawn close
to a trap) (I swear I did not do that on purpose it just messes up my program to spawn you 
somewhere else)

What did I use from the course?

Creating this game used things that I have learned throughout the course such as loops, 
conditional statements, methods and JFrames. I feel like creating this game not only challenged
my knowledge on these things from the course, but also helped me learn/imrpove my ability 
to use them.
